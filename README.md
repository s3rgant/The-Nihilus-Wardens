**The Nihilus Wardens**

“We survived the night. Now we are the knife that keeps it at bay.”

**Origins**

When the Cicatrix Maledictum tore the galaxy in half, entire Astra Militarum regiments were erased in moments—swallowed by warp storms, daemonic incursions, or the far worse fate of being forgotten. In the chaos of those opening days, several Tempestus Scion detachments and Cadian Kasrkin kill-teams found themselves cut off behind the rift, operating without Astropathic contact, resupply, or hope of reinforcement.

These were not fresh troops.

They were veterans—soldiers who had already fought Orks in hive warrens, Tyranids in ash storms, and Chaos in the dying light of a hundred doomed worlds. When the galaxy broke, they did not panic.

They adapted.

**The Inquisitor’s Mandate**

Their survival drew the attention of Inquisitor [Name Placeholder], Ordo [Xenos / Hereticus / Malleus—dealer’s choice], operating under an open-ended mandate to preserve Imperial authority in Imperial Nihilus by any means necessary.

Realising that conventional command structures were effectively dead beyond the Rift, the Inquisitor enacted an emergency consolidation order:

Scions provided rapid-deployment, void-capable strike elements

Kasrkin served as hardened shock troops and urban pacification forces

Command authority flowed directly from the Inquisitor, bypassing all regimental bureaucracy (which, in Nihilus, mostly consists of screaming and fire)

The resulting force became a permanent, semi-autonomous warband—technically Astra Militarum, functionally an Inquisitorial scalpel.

**The Early Horror**

The opening months after the Rift’s expansion were the worst.

Warp entities manifested without warning. Loyalist worlds turned on themselves. Entire populations fell to madness or false prophets within days. Several engagements ended with Scions executing Imperial governors while Kasrkin cleared Administratum bunkers room by room.

Not all enemies wore the marks of Chaos.

Some simply broke.

The units that survived did so because they learned a brutal truth early:

There would be no relief. No reinforcement. No evacuation.

Only those willing to act decisively—and often without mercy—lived long enough to become veterans of Nihilus.
